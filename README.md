## About the Game

FireBusters VR is a virtual reality game that enhances the fire safety education experience for you through a fun and immersive journey. By creating a safe space to experiment and play with various classes of fires, we hope to educate you about the different fire extinguishers available and increase your fire safety knowledge. Our open-world concept also enables you to freely interact with various fire extinguishers or even flammable objects to create huge fires.

## Description of game levels

Our game consists of 3 levels as follows:
1. Fire Extinguisher Level: You'll have to identify the correct fire extinguisher to extinguish the different flammable objects in the scene.

2. Sandbox Level: You are free to experiment ways of starting and putting our fires by interacting with a variety of objects.

3. Fire Escape Level: You have to identify the appropriate and relevant steps to take in a fire evacuation scenario to leave the building safely.
