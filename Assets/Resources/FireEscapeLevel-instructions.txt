Welcome to the Fire Escape level.

Your neighbour has accidentally created a small fire at the common corridor.

Your task will be to trigger the fire alarm and find the nearest fire exit staircase and escape the building. 

The Fire Fighter will be waiting to save you at the end of the exit staircase.
