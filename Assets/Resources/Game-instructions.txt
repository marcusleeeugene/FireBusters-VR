We aim to make fire safety training fun and interactive for students.
Our game consists of 3 levels as follows:
1. Fire class level to identify the correct fire extinguisher to extinguish different flammable objects.
2. Sandbox level to experiment ways to start and put out fires.
3. Fire Escape level with interactive scenarios to choose to leave the building safely.
